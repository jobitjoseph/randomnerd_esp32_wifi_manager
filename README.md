if you use MY version of the randomnerd wifimanager

i think it is better NOT to post problems to Rui's & Sara's RandomNerd Tutorials Page

My version CQ Electra is SO Different, They Rui & Sara will think you are Nuts, Crazy, Talking NonSense. AbraCaDabra ;-)

not so handy older video http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mrQwdB_dm_U

       Bet you can make a better video ;-)

ESP32 RELAIS

NO WiFi settings hardcoded  (ssid pass ip gateway subnet mdns)

DHCP IP or Fixed IP ADDRESS

mDNS URL

Arduino IDE

program the ESP32 with the file -> ESP32_WiFi_Manager.ino

upload data directory to spiffs => HOWTODOTHAT?! => https://randomnerdtutorials.com/install-esp32-filesystem-uploader-arduino-ide/

connect to esp32 wifi AccesPoint "ESP-WIFI-MANAGER" direct and browse to 192.168.4.1

configure your settings in wifmanager

Play and have fun with Electra

Arduino IDE wants to place the ino file in a new directory => "ESP32_WiFi_Manager"

Make sure to move the "data" directory into the Arduino IDE created directory => "ESP32_WiFi_Manager"

Arduino IDE->menu->sketch->show sketch folder->should show the "data" directory

## Electra Schedule, Schedule Electra (not Working yet... Help?)

Easy set & overview and a load of switchtimes (more and better as most commercial paid programs/apps)

Each device its own schedule webpage

Esp32 scan for other devices on the local network

Mdns scan on esp32 serial monitor scanstr html links to other devices in the network

Electra scans every 10 seconds to see what devices there are in the local network

if you add a new device => it will list a link to it on each devices webpage with a human friendly link

## Electra's Sneak Sleek Peek Preview, Future Up/Download, Edit, Delete

## OnLine InBrowser Manage Contents of LittleFS on ESP8266, FileManager

Wouldn't it be nice to change the feel, look, sound, taste, smell of Electra with different Skins

upload another html/css and make Electra look different?! or modify, hack or edit it online, inbrowser, yourself

Can you do that with your paid app? ;-)

looks like it also does multifile upload if multi-selected files are dropped on dropzone

https://github.com/holgerlembke/ESPxWebFlMgr

it could use an extra column for preview files   

and maybe c99shell like icons is better, letter confuse me is D for Download or Delete, is  R Rename or Remove

icons in c99shell are an array of encoded base64 images https://github.com/4Hackerz/C99-Shell/blob/4a0b6f06c82a69c87ee23e413e55860d3df15ed3/c99.php#L2676

Warning DO Not put above file on a php webserver or putins army wil f-up your device

image array starts at line 2676

  decode base64 encoded images https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image

# like next, and dont like it

## X-HX0293A

do not like that it has no usb connection

Needs an FTDI programmer at3.3v or esp01 programmer with some wires

people have problems with what to fill in on ip gateway and subnetmask fields

should be possible to first boot dhcp 

after connect store ip/gate/sub restart/reboot and use read ip/gate/sub data 

and restart with fixed ip == autoconnect 2.0?

asked maker of bonjourbrowser app if he can display network info in his bonjoutbrowser app

to make life eassier
