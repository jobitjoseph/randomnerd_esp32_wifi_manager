people have problems with what to fill in on ip gateway and subnetmask fields

should be possible to first boot dhcp 

after connect store ip/gate/sub restart/reboot and use read ip/gate/sub data 

and restart with fixed ip == autoconnect 2.0?

asked maker of bonjourbrowser app if he can display network info in his bonjoutbrowser app

to make life eassier
