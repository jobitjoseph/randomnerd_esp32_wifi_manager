Simple Looks, No OverKill (Maybe make it SkinAble, For Those who like OverKill)

ECO mode = continu low heat setpoint energy saving setpoint (14C?)

NORMAL mode = continu heat comfortable setpoint (21C?)

AUTO mode = Switch heat temperature on programmed times with temperature

COOL mode = continu setpoint cooling airco/ventilator (25C?)

## First time EasyEDA.com and JLCPCB.com and LCSC.com == Perfect!	

My ESP32 TFT prototype test board, extra row of female connnectors for connecting devices test pinout

Only the holes ar a bit tight, but female row headers fit => Next time, double side copper PCB

And Ground the copper poor infill

## DS3231 RTC with NTC Thermistor soldered onto power 

## sorry i switched to BME280 sensor temp. humid. barometer sensor == much better 

VCC on RTC DS3231 is 3.3V

Less Wires = Only a Signal wire from NTC Thermistor

NTC Connect => (-GND to VCC+3.3V) (VCC+3.3V to -GND) In Other Words Silkscreen print - should be + 

(This way its PULLDOWN) NTC Signal Line pulled down to ground
```diff
-Art's TFT screen will tell you how to connect the wires to ESP32 on startup

-On first boot Art's screen is Snowy for 20 seconds => I think Art is Formatting his Brain/Flash


```
ESP32 Note: Analog noise and fluctuences with analog read => multiread and capacitorÂ 

https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/adc.html

Not so clear for me as DIY Tinker  => think they want a 0.1mf 100uf capacitor between signal and ground to damp the analog read

## TFT Backlight PWM cut the LED track to 3.3V

i have cut the LED track to 3.3V between the Pads

soldered a wire on the LED side pad

LED connected Wire connected to GPIO15 for the moment

Can now control the BackLight PWM from the screen/slidebar

in the LOOP{} is a hardcoded setting for now => dim screen if hour > ?? and < as ??

Jo's Energy Saver ;-)

a touch in top of screen in the blue rectangle => opens the settings menu

Blue border rectangle = Heating / Cooling is OFF

DutchOrange border Rectangle = The Heat is ON

IceBlue border Rectangle = Cooling is ON

#
## Art output relais  heat & cool or single relais

the double relaiscoil is optical isolated swithed by optocoupler

the single relaiscoil is switched by transistor

a bit big relais for most off the time 24VAC CentralHeatingSystem switching

GND=GND

VCC = +5V (for the relais Coil) ESP32 +5VDC is comming from  USB

IN1, IN2 = if pulled low to GND => relais==ON (GPIO25 and GPIO26 from ESP32)

===== maybe Disconnect relais when programming ESP32  ======

## Art's Sensor BME280 Temperature, Humidity, Barometer (4Future)

ESP32 BME280 sensor test 

https://github.com/ldijkman/ART-ESP32-Touch-TFT-Thermostat/blob/main/test/ESP32_BME280_barometer_humidity_temperature_sensor_test.ino

#

BME280 humidity a scale makes vissible how whe ar doing with RV%

got my barometer pressure info from my pi webserver page http://84.107.155.75/

HE IS DAT HTTP://ARDUINO.Tk

## Art with Linear Humidity Comfort Scale

#
## Art with Linear BaroMeter and Humidity Comfort Scale

No it's not a slider, Art can not change the weather!

## This is wat your Arduino IDE should look like, Main File with the TAB files	

ART_ESP32_Thermostat_7_12_2020_ver2.ino => is the Main File	

The other *.INO files are included tab files (Should be in the same Directory as Main File)
