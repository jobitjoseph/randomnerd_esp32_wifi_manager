make sure u use LittleFS data upload, NOT SPIFFS

the LAN mDNS scan linked list could be better if it asks the status of the other devices

and show a yellow or gray link button depnding on status

and maybe link to /on /off to switch from other device

like i did on this TFT LCD display https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qviv5TOcVo
