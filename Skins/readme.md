Electra looks a bit HTMLisch

Maybe a darker Skin, more app alike styled would be better for Electra

Anyone handy with HTML / CSS?

Help Electra Make Look Better?  https://jsfiddle.net/luberth/sx61b08t/show


===

if Electra had a FileManager https://github.com/ldijkman/ESPxWebFlMgr

We can upload index.htm or style.css to modify Electra's Skin

or we can edit the files in ESP's LittleFS online inbrowser with the filemanager https://github.com/ldijkman/ESPxWebFlMgr
