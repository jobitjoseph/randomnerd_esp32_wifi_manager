- Wath i have in mind https://github.com/ldijkman/randomnerd_esp32_wifi_manager/tree/main/Skins
- change the look of your wifi relais switch by edit or upload new index.html and maybe other image/js/css files for index.html Skin
- each wifi relais switch has its own fsbrowser filemanager / editor

U Got that Look!, Anyone handy with HTML / CSS? #5

U Got that Look! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jCuroTbqBI , Color you Peach and Black

Electra looks a bit HTMLisch

Maybe a darker Skin, more app alike styled would be better for Electra

Anyone handy with HTML / CSS / javascript / images / sounds?

Help Electra Make Look Better?  https://jsfiddle.net/luberth/sx61b08t/show

if Electra had a FileManager 

https://github.com/ldijkman/randomnerd_esp32_wifi_manager/tree/main/ESP8266-LittleFS-wifi-manager/ESP8266-LittleFS-wifi-manager_with_editor

We can upload index.htm or style.css to modify Electra's Skin

or we can edit the files in ESP's LittleFS online inbrowser with the filemanager https://github.com/ldijkman/ESPxWebFlMgr

for the moment i switched to a working example of espasyncwebserver littlefs fsbrowser ESP8266
