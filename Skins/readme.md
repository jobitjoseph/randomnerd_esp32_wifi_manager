U Got that Look!

Electra looks a bit HTMLisch

Maybe a darker Skin, more app alike styled would be better for Electra

Anyone handy with HTML / CSS?

Help Electra?


===

if Electra had a FileManager https://github.com/ldijkman/randomnerd_esp32_wifi_manager#electras-sneak-sleek-peek-preview-future-updownload-edit-delete

We can upload index.htm or style.css to modify Electra's Skin

or we can edit the files in ESP's LittleFS online inbrowser with the filemanager ESPxWebFlMgr
